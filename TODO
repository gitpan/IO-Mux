- Split writes into small (1K, 4K, ?) chunks in order to make IO::Mux::Select
  more performant. However this will make error reporting for the write function
  more complex. Maybe using syswrite would be better there. Trap difference between
  PRINT and WRITE in order to support syswrite. PRINT should do WRITE until everything
  is written.
